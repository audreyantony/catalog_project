        <h3>Our History</h3>
        <p>Back in the 1980s, our founder Ronda Fergusonâ€™s job was to clean and maintain components for commercial aircraft. It was tough work using industrial cleaning products for which heavy-duty safety equipment, including a respirator, had to be worn. Ronda was shocked to discover that many of the ingredients in the products she used at work could also be found in everyday household cleaners. It prompted her to look for naturally-derived alternatives that would clean safely and effectively without harming her family, pets, friends or the environment, and in 1987, All-natural Artifacts was born !<br><br>
            The main ingredient in detergents are surfactants, but they are usually made from petroleum. But oil is far from being our best friend ... What solution have we adopted? We have returned to nature, all the pure or processed ingredients available in our stores are organic and above all, of quality. The brands available have all been carefully chosen and trust us in the distribution of their products.<br><br>
            In 1999, Damian, Ronda's son joined her at the head of the thriving small business and two years later the second store opened. Together they set up the sale of DIY kits long before it became a trend and thanks to the increase in the use of organic products, the company will grow again in 2015 by opening their third store in the Paris suburbs.</p>
